### Programming technology stack I have tried yet:
- `C#/VB.NET` WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for Windows Desktop Application.
- `Java` Java Web SpringBoot backend.
- `TypeScript` Vue.js (vue3 & vite & TypeScript) frontend.
- `C#` ASP.NET backend.
- `F#` Write Utils using F# script for my own. F# is the best scripting language for me.
- `Python` Only basic knowledge of some well-known libraries in Data Science fields such as `numpy`, `sympy`, `pandas`,`spacy`, but I rarely use Python because I don't like weakly typed language.
- `c/cpp` I learned it but haven't applied it to any big project.
- `Rust` Rust is well-designed and fantastic, but not productive for me.
- `Go` GoLang is easy to use, but I need more convenient `Syntactic Sugar`.
